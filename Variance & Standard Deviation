The variance (σ2) is a measure of how far each value in the data set is from the mean.
The standard deviation (σ) is simply the (positive) square root of the variance.

CODE
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
incomes = np.random.normal(100.0, 50.0, 10000) # (center, SD=50, sample quantity)
plt.hist(incomes, 50)#(quantity of barcel)
plt.show()
income.std() #standard diviation 
income.var() #variance
