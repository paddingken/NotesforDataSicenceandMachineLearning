autodiff
  We need the first partial derivatives of all the inputs, reverse-mode autodiff to the rescue. (Tensorflow)
Softmax
  Be used for classification
    Given a score for each class
    Prodece a probability of each class
    The highest probability is the "answer"
Grandient decent is an algorithm for minimizing error over multiple steps
Autodiff is a calculus trick for finding the gradients in gradient descent
Softmax is a function for choosing the most probable classdification given several input values

LTU Linear Threshold Unit (LTU)

Perceptron
  A layer of LTUs
  A perceptron can learn by reinforcing weights that laed to correct behavior during training
